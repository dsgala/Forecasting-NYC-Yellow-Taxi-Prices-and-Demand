# Forecasting-NYC-Yellow-Taxi-Prices-and-Demand

# Overview:

This project attempts to analyze the Yellow Taxi trip data collected by
the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. Our goal in this analysis is
to determine if this data can provide meaningful insights around taxi
user behavioral data, tipping and pricing, as well as long-term
macroeconomic trends such as competition, exogenous shocks that
have impacted taxi volumes and pricing over time.
